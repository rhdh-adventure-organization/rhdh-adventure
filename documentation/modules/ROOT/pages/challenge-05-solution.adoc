[#softwaretemplate-solution]
== ðŸ§žðŸ’€ Software Template

Software templates are pre-configured building blocks that help developers jump start their projects.
These templates provide a standardized starting point for applications, saving developers time and effort
by eliminating the need to manually configure common elements.

Software templates describe specific architectures or type of applications so they are multiple cases.
Red Hat Developer Hub provides a set of examples in a repository as starting point, however, there are
multiple examples or specific use cases not included there.

Templates can be registered from the `Create...` menu. The `Register Existing Component` button opens
a wizard to register the component from the remote url.

For example, this is a link:https://github.com/rhdh-adventure-organization/angular-template-gh[software template]
for an Angular app. Register it by the UI.

Software Template url: `https://github.com/rhdh-adventure-organization/angular-template-gh/blob/main/template.yaml`

For example, this is a link:https://github.com/rhdh-adventure-organization/node-template-gl[software template]
for a Node.JS app. Register it by the UI.

Software Template url: `https://github.com/rhdh-adventure-organization/node-template-gl/blob/main/template.yaml`

Another alternative is to configure the location of the templates in the `catalog` definition.
This is the configuration to add in the `app-config-rhdh` ConfigMap:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
    catalog:
      locations:
        - type: url
          target: https://github.com/redhat-developer/red-hat-developer-hub-software-templates/blob/main/templates.yaml
          rules:
            - allow: [Template]
----

This command will help:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
sed -e "s|\$rhdhname|$rhdhname|g" \
    -e "s|\$basedomain|$basedomain|g" \
    ./documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/challenge-05/rhdh-app-config-cm-github.yaml | oc apply -f -
----

The operator will redeploy the instance to apply the new changes. For a Helm release, we need
to rollout the deployment.
