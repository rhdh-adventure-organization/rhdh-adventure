= 🕵🏻‍♂️ Import an Existing App
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Your application is running and operational, but it's not yet part of the Red Hat Developer Hub catalog.
To truly unlock its potential, it needs to be discoverable and shareable with your entire team.
This challenge invites you to prepare your application for seamless integration into the catalog.

In this stage, you will:

* Add key metadata to your application, including links to the source code repository, documentation,
dependencies (if applicable), and APIs (if applicable).
* Learn how to register components manually and, for larger projects, discover how to do this at scale
using the Red Hat Developer Hub's automation capabilities.

The challenge is complete when your component is:

* Successfully registered in the catalog.
* Includes all relevant links and resources to ensure collaboration and transparency.
* Accessible to your team and ready to be leveraged by developers across your organization.

Get ready to explore, collaborate, and elevate your application to the next level by integrating it
into the Red Hat Developer Hub catalog. Once complete, your application will no longer just
"exist"—it will become a **centralized, shareable asset** for your organization.
