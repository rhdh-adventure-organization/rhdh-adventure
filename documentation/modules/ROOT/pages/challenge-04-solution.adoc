Any component must be registered into the Red Hat Developer Hub catalog.

The Software Catalog as its name implies, is a catalog of software components. It is designed to replace
ad-hoc, informal systems that do not scale to handle the sprawl of modern cloud-native application ecosystems.
Maintaining a software catalog massively simplifies the Onboarding Process for new developers joining the
organization, or a new project. The catalog lets you discover all registered components in the catalog,
as well as explore the APIs, the teams that own and operate them, issues, CI/CD pipeline status, and
technical documentation in a single easily accessible place. The component information is kept up to date
by the respective teams (in their corresponding Git repositories), and Red Hat Developer Hub periodically pulls
the latest metadata to maintain the information in near realtime.

Adding items to the catalog is done using YAML files, typically stored in source control systems like Git.
These YAML files live alongside, and in the same source code repository as the source code of the software
components. The way to declare a component to be loaded into the catalog is by the
link:https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format/[`catalog-info.yaml`] file.

Here there is a minimum example describing a sample component, for example a library:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: sample-library
  description: |
    This is a sample library.
  links:
    - title: Red Hat Developer Hub Documentation
      url: https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub
  annotations:
    backstage.io/kubernetes-id: sample-library
    backstage.io/techdocs-ref: dir:.
spec:
  type: library
  lifecycle: production
  owner: team-a
----

Choose a repository in your GitHub or GitLab instance and add a similar file in that repo.

CAUTION: The repository must be public to be accessible (public visibility) to be added into the catalog.

[#import-solution]
== üßûüìÇ Import it

The xref:challenge-03.adoc#intro[Lock It Down] challenge included a set of steps to integrate
Red Hat Developer Hub and your favourite SCM (e.g: GitHub, GitLab). That integration included
some features to discover organization data, including repositories to add automatically into
the Red Hat Developer Hub catalog.

If your challenged was completed successfully, after some minutes the repository updated with
the `catalog-info.yaml` file should be listed in Catalog of Red Hat Developer Hub similar as:

image::challenge-04/rhdh-catalog.png[Catalog of Components registered]

Otherwise, there is another way to import or register a new component into the catalog.
From the `Create...` menu, there is a button named as `Register Existing Component`:

image::challenge-04/rhdh-register-existing-component.png[Register Existing Component button]

Using a full URL to a repo that includes a `catalog-info.yaml` it can be registered.
For example, adding the link:https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/catalog-info.yaml[https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/catalog-info.yaml]
in that button, we can register the Backstage application (upstream project of Red Hat Developer Hub).

The definition of the new component in the catalog will be similar to:
