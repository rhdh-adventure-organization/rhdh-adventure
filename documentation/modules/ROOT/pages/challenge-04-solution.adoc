[#declare-solution]
== 🧞📝 Declare it Solution

Any component to be registered into the Red Hat Developer Hub catalog requires a file called
link:https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format/[`catalog-info.yaml`] describing it.

Here there is a minimum example describing a sample component, for example a library:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: sample-library
  description: |
    This is a sample library.
  links:
    - title: Red Hat Developer Hub Documentation
      url: https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub
  annotations:
    backstage.io/kubernetes-id: sample-library
    backstage.io/techdocs-ref: dir:.
    github.com/project-slug: rhdh-adventure-organization/sample-library
spec:
  type: library
  lifecycle: production
  owner: team-a
----

Choose a repository in your GitHub or GitLab instance and add a similar file in that repo.

[#import-solution]
== 🧞📂 Import it

The xref:challenge-03.adoc#intro[Lock It Down] challenge included a set of steps to integrate
Red Hat Developer Hub and your favourite SCM (e.g: GitHub, GitLab). That integration included
some features to discover organization data, including repositories to add automatically into
the Red Hat Developer Hub catalog.

If your challenged was completed successfully, after some minutes the repository updated with
the `catalog-info.yaml` file should be listed in Catalog of Red Hat Developer Hub similar as:

image::challenge-04/rhdh-catalog.png[Catalog of Components registered]

Otherwise, there is another way to import or register a new component into the catalog.
From the `Create...` menu, there is a button named as `Register Existing Component`:

image::challenge-04/rhdh-register-existing-component.png[Register Existing Component button]

Using a full URL to a repo that includes a `catalog-info.yaml` it can be registered.
For example, adding the link:https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/catalog-info.yaml[https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/catalog-info.yaml]
in that button, we can register the Backstage application (upstream project of Red Hat Developer Hub).

The definition of the new component in the catalog will be similar to:
