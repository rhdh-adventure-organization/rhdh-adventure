[#intro]
== üé® Make It Your Own!

Do you have your Red Hat Developer Hub instance ready? Great!, now it is time to customize it for you and
prepare it for adding more configurations in the future, and facilitate the maintenance and operation.
Here the adventure will give the opportunity to customize the following features:

* Using `ConfigMaps` and `Secrets` objects to store configuration
* Adding your own title
* Defining your colors

Here you will practice how to configure and customize Red Hat Developer Hub to apply common things.
You will learn how to use ConfigMaps and Secrets to update your instance for the rest of the challenges
and take it to the next level by customizing its behavior.

This challenge is considered successful when:

* External objects, such as `ConfigMaps` and `Secrets`, are correctly created and linked to the application deployment.
* The application reflects the custom title provided through the configuration.
* The look and feel of the application is distinctly different from its original state, demonstrating successful visual customization.

By the end of this challenge, you will have gained valuable hands-on experience in externalizing configuration,
customizing deployments dynamically, and delivering a unique application experience‚Äîall essential skills for
deploying scalable and adaptable Red Hat Developer Hub solutions in OpenShift environments.

IMPORTANT: This challenge requires the successful completion of the previous challenge.

[#configuration]
== üõ†Ô∏è External configuration

In the first activity, you'll create external objects, such as ConfigMaps and Secrets, to define
configurations for your application. These external configurations will enable customization without
modifying the application's deployment manifests directly, showcasing the flexibility of Red Hat Developer Hub.

[#title]
== ¬©Ô∏è Title it!

Building on the previous activity, you will extend the configuration to include a title that appears
in the Red Hat Developer Hub landing page. This will demonstrate how to dynamically inject specific
custom settings into the application.

the color scheme or other visual elements. This step emphasizes the ability to completely transform the
user experience while maintaining separation of concerns between deployment and configuration.
