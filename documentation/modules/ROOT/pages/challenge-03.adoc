Your Red Hat Developer Hub looks great... However, it is not a secure place to work.
Security is important in any adventure, so it is time to secure our instance with
real users and authorization policies to avoid security issues in the future.
What do you want to conquer?

* Authentication with GitHub
* Authentication with GitLab
* (You won't break it) Enable authorization for your new users (RBAC)

This challenge focuses on adding essential authentication and authorization capabilities to
your Red Hat Developer Hub deployment. By securing it with robust access control mechanisms,
you'll not only protect your users but also establish a foundation for maintaining trust and
mitigating future security risks.

The challenge will be considered successful when:

* The application is integrated with an external identity provider and successfully authenticates users from that provider.
* Authorization policies are implemented, and different users have distinct access levels. For example, one user may be allowed to perform an action, while another is restricted.

By completing this challenge, you'll enhance the security posture of Red Hat Developer Hub, gaining hands-on
experience with integrating authentication and authorization mechanisms. These skills are essential for
developing secure, user-friendly applications in today's interconnected world.

Let's lock it down and secure your Red Hat Developer Hub! 🔒

IMPORTANT: This challenge requires the successful completion of the previous challenge.

[#github-auth]
== 🔑 Authentication with GitHub

Here you will integrate GitHub as Identity Provider of Red Hat Developer Hub allowing authenticate users
(developers or platform engineers).

Use a public organization or your own user in link:https://github.com[GitHub] as external Identity Provider.

To resolve this challenge you can start checking the following references:

[#gitlab-auth]
== 🔑 Authentication with GitLab

Here you will integrate GitHub as Identity Provider of Red Hat Developer Hub allowing authenticate users
(developers or platform engineers).

Use a public organization or your own user in link:https://gitlab.com[GitLab] as external Identity Provider.
Otherwise, the cluster provides a local instance of GitLab available at:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
echo https://gitlab.$basedomain
----

There are different users created (`user1`, `user2`, `userX`...), using the same credentials (`@abc1cde2`).

[#rbac]
== 🛂 You won't break it

Building on the authentication setup, this activity introduces authorization policies to define and enforce
what authenticated users are allowed to do. You'll create rules within the application to grant or restrict
access to specific features or actions, ensuring users have the correct permissions based on their roles.
