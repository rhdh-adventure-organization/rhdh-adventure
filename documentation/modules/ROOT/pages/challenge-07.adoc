We've reached the final stage of our adventure! Your Red Hat Developer Hub is nearly complete, a fully functional
and streamlined platform. But there's one critical question left unanswered: How is it performing?
To unlock the full potential of your instance, you must measure its usage, monitor its health, and capture key
performance data. After all, a platform is only as effective as the insights you can gain from it.

In this stage, you'll dive into monitoring and observability—essential tools for understanding how your platform
behaves and ensuring it runs smoothly.

This stage is complete when:

* Metrics from the product are exposed and available for analysis.
* Logs and events are reviewed and understood.
* Performance and behavior of the platform are captured, providing actionable insights for future improvements.

With this stage, you'll ensure your Red Hat Developer Hub is not just operational but optimized.
By integrating monitoring and observability tools, you gain the power to proactively manage your platform,
maintain its health, and continuously improve its performance. This is your moment to master the art of insight
and complete your adventure in style. Ready to unlock the final piece? Let's go!
