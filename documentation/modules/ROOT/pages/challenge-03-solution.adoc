[#intro-solution]
== 🧞👨‍💻 Welcome Devs

Your Red Hat Developer Hub looks great … However, it is not a secure place to work. Security is important in any adventure, so it is time to secure our instance with real users and authorization policies to avoid security issues in the future. What do you want to conquer?

* Authentication with GitHub
* Authentication with GitLab
* (You won't break it) Enable authorization for your new users (RBAC)

Here you will integrate a SCM server as Identity Provider of Red Hat Developer Hub allowing authenticate users (developers or platform engineers). You will learn how to integrate one of those SCM in your exercise and define different rules or policies about which kind of activities are allowed for each of them.
