[#dynamicplugins-solution]
== ðŸ§žðŸ¦„ Dynamic Plugins

In the xref:challenge-03.adoc[challenge], you played a bit with some dynamic plugins provided for authentication
and authorization provided by Red Hat Developer Hub. However, you could not bit completely the goal of the
dynamic plugins.

Red Hat Developer Hub as a platform consists of a small modular core and an extensive set of plugins that provide most of
the functionality. In the upstream **Backstage.io** platform, enabling a plugin means modifying the platform's source code
to load a bunch of TypeScript/JavaScript, and other static files (HTML, CSS, images etc.).
You then have to stop and restart the runtime to enable the plugin.

This approach of changing source code and restarting for enabling plugins will not work for Red Hat Developer Hub,
because you need to recompile the source code, build a new container image and then re-deploy the new container image.

Red Hat has introduced the concept of a **dynamic plugin** to overcome this hurdle. A set of curated plugins are pre-baked into
the container image, but not enabled by default. The **dynamic plugin framework** is based on the
link:https://github.com/scalprum/scaffolding[Node.js Scalprum library]. To enable or disable a plugin, you edit the **app-config.yaml**
or the Red Hat Developer Hub Helm chart YAML values and turn plugins on or off.
In this manner, Red Hat Developer Hub allows you to control plugin lifecycle and configuration without recompiling
or rebuilding container images.

Red Hat Developer Hub is pre-loaded with a selection of dynamic plugins. Most of these dynamic plugins are disabled by default due
to the need for mandatory configuration. For a complete list of dynamic plugins that are included, see the
https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.5/html/dynamic_plugins_reference/con-preinstalled-dynamic-plugins#red-hat-supported-plugins[dynamic plugins matrix]
section of Red Hat Developer Hub.

NOTE: Red Hat fully supports certain plugins (Topology, Tekton, Quay), while others are community-supported projects.

Enabling or disabling dynamic plugins is based in the link:https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/packages/backend-dynamic-feature-service[backend plugin manager]
package, which is a service that scans a configured root directory (`dynamicPlugins.rootDirectory` in the `app-config.yaml`)
for dynamic plugin packages, and loads them dynamically.

The configuration of the dynamic plugins depends of the mechanism used to operate Red Hat Developer Hub:

[tabs]
====
By Helm Chart::
+
--
The definition of the dynamic plugins is done in the `values.yaml` file in the `global.dynamic.plugins` list:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
global:
  # Other configurations
  dynamic:
    includes:
      - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
    plugins:
      - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-github-dynamic
        disabled: false
      - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-github-org-dynamic
        disabled: false
      - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-github-dynamic
        disabled: false
----
--
By Operator::
+
--
The operator creates the `dynamic-plugins-rhdh-local` ConfigMap with the list of dynamic plugins. We can
create another additional ConfigMap to manage it.

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::example$challenge-03/rhdh-dynamic-plugins-cm-github-01.yaml[]
----

Update the Red Hat Developer Hub manifest to use the new ConfigMap for plugins:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
spec:
  application:
    # Other configurations
    dynamicPluginsConfigMapName: rhdh-dynamic-plugins
----
--
====

[WARNING]
====
Simply enabling a dynamic plugin in the helm chart may not provide the required functionality. You may need to
edit your `app-config.yaml` files to add plugin-specific configuration (for example, set different environment variables)
to make the plugin work correctly. Consult the corresponding plugin documentation for the required configuration.
====

However, there is a way to include other dynamic plugins not included in Red Hat Developer Hub. This is a process based
on exporting third-party plugins using:

* The link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@janus-idp/cli[@janus-idp/cli] package is installed.
* Node.js and NPM is installed and configured.
* The third-party plugin is compatible with your Red Hat Developer Hub version.
For more information, see link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh/blob/main/docs/dynamic-plugins/versions.md[Version compatibility matrix].
* The third-party plugin must have a valid `package.json` file in its root directory, containing all required metadata and dependencies.

The following resources includes a full list of the current plugins in the Backstage space:

* link:https://backstage.io/plugins[Backstage Plugin Directory]
* link:https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins[Backstage Community Plugins]

A detailed guide to install third-party plugins is available
https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.5/html-single/installing_and_viewing_plugins_in_red_hat_developer_hub/index#ref-example-third-party-plugin-installation_assembly-install-third-party-plugins-rhdh[here].

We will do the exercise to install some plugins using the dynamic plugin framework of Red Hat Developer Hub.

=== TODO Plugin (Backstage Community Plugin)

This plugin lists `// TODO` comments in source code. It currently exports a single component extension for use on entity pages.

The main steps:

1. Clone and install locally

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins
cd community-plugins/workspaces/todo
yarn install
yarn tsc
----

2. Export as dynamic plugin each module (backend, frontent):

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cd plugins/todo-backend
npx @janus-idp/cli@latest package export-dynamic-plugin
cd ../todo
npx @janus-idp/cli@latest package export-dynamic-plugin
----

3. Export as container image:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cd ../..
npx @janus-idp/cli@latest package package-dynamic-plugins \
    --tag quay.io/rhdh-adventure-organization/backstage-community-plugin-todo:v0.1.2
----

This process will output the default configuration of the dynamic plugin to add into Red Hat Developer Hub:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
    plugins:
      - package: oci://quay.io/rhdh-adventure-organization/backstage-community-plugin-todo:v0.1.2!backstage-community-plugin-todo
        pluginConfig:
          dynamicPlugins:
            frontend:
              backstage-community.plugin-todo:
                mountPoints:
                  - mountPoint: entity.page.todo/cards
                    importName: EntityTodoContent
                entityTabs:
                  - path: /todo
                    title: Todo
                    mountPoint: entity.page.todo
      - package: oci://quay.io/rhdh-adventure-organization/backstage-community-plugin-todo:v0.1.2!backstage-community-plugin-todo-backend-dynamic
        disabled: false
----

4. Push the image into a Container Image Registry:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman push quay.io/rhdh-adventure-organization/backstage-community-plugin-todo:v0.1.2
----

WARNING: Don't forget to make public the repository.

=== Dev Quotes Plugin

Display some random coding/programming related quotes on the Backstage homepage.

1. Clone and install locally

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/Parsifal-M/backstage-dev-quotes
cd backstage-dev-quotes/
yarn install
yarn tsc
yarn build
----

2. Export as dynamic plugin each module (backend, frontent):

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
npx @janus-idp/cli@latest package export-dynamic-plugin
----

3. Export as container image:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
npx @janus-idp/cli@latest package package-dynamic-plugins \
    --tag quay.io/rhdh-adventure-organization/backstage-dev-quotes-dynamic-plugin:v0.0.1
----

This command generates the default configuration to apply:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
      - package: oci://quay.io/rhdh-adventure-organization/backstage-dev-quotes-dynamic-plugin:v0.0.1!parsifal-m-plugin-dev-quotes-homepage
        disabled: false
        pluginConfig:
          dynamicPlugins:
            frontend:
              parsifal-m.plugin-dev-quotes-homepage:
                mountPoints:
                  - mountPoint: entity.page.overview/cards
                    importName: DevQuote
                    config:
                      layout:
                        gridColumnEnd:
                          lg: span 4
                          md: span 6
                          xs: span 12
                dynamicRoutes:
                  - importName: DevQuote
                    menuItem:
                      text: Quote
                    path: /devquote
----

4. Push the image into a Container Image Registry:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman push quay.io/rhdh-adventure-organization/backstage-dev-quotes-dynamic-plugin:v0.0.1
----

=== Enabling the new plugins

Once we have the configuration for each plugin, we can apply as:

[tabs]
====
By Helm Chart::
+
--
Extend the `values.yaml` file to add the list of plugins to use and upgrade the Helm release:

For GitHub:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
helm upgrade --install rhdh \
    openshift-helm-charts/redhat-developer-hub \
    -f ./documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/challenge-06/values-01-github.yaml \
    --set global.clusterRouterBase=$basedomain

The Dev Quote is available as another menu of Red Hat Developer Hub:

image::challenge-06/rhdh-dev-quote-plugin.png[]

And each component includes a new tab for the TODO plugin.
