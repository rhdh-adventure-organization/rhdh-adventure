[#dynamicplugins-solution]
== 🧞🦄 Dynamic Plugins

In the xref:challenge-03.adoc[challenge], you played a bit with some dynamic plugins provided for authentication
and authorization provided by Red Hat Developer Hub. However, you could not bit completely the goal of the
dynamic plugins.

Red Hat Developer Hub as a platform consists of a small modular core and an extensive set of plugins that provide most of
the functionality. In the upstream **Backstage.io** platform, enabling a plugin means modifying the platform's source code
to load a bunch of TypeScript/JavaScript, and other static files (HTML, CSS, images etc.).
You then have to stop and restart the runtime to enable the plugin.

This approach of changing source code and restarting for enabling plugins will not work for Red Hat Developer Hub,
because you need to recompile the source code, build a new container image and then re-deploy the new container image.

Red Hat has introduced the concept of a **dynamic plugin** to overcome this hurdle. A set of curated plugins are pre-baked into
the container image, but not enabled by default. The **dynamic plugin framework** is based on the
link:https://github.com/scalprum/scaffolding[Node.js Scalprum library]. To enable or disable a plugin, you edit the **app-config.yaml**
or the Red Hat Developer Hub Helm chart YAML values and turn plugins on or off.
In this manner, Red Hat Developer Hub allows you to control plugin lifecycle and configuration without recompiling
or rebuilding container images.

Red Hat Developer Hub is pre-loaded with a selection of dynamic plugins. Most of these dynamic plugins are disabled by default due
to the need for mandatory configuration. For a complete list of dynamic plugins that are included, see the
https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.8/html/dynamic_plugins_reference/con-preinstalled-dynamic-plugins#red-hat-supported-plugins[dynamic plugins matrix]
section of Red Hat Developer Hub.

NOTE: Red Hat fully supports certain plugins (Topology, Tekton, Quay), while others are community-supported projects.

Enabling or disabling dynamic plugins is based in the link:https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/packages/backend-dynamic-feature-service[backend plugin manager]
package, which is a service that scans a configured root directory (`dynamicPlugins.rootDirectory` in the `app-config.yaml`)
for dynamic plugin packages, and loads them dynamically.

The configuration of the dynamic plugins depends of the mechanism used to operate Red Hat Developer Hub:

[tabs]
====
By Helm Chart::
+
--
The definition of the dynamic plugins is done in the `values.yaml` file in the `global.dynamic.plugins` list:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
global:
  # Other configurations
  dynamic:
    includes:
      - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
    plugins:
      - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-github-dynamic
        disabled: false
      - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-github-org-dynamic
        disabled: false
      - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-github-dynamic
        disabled: false
----
--
By Operator::
+
--
The operator creates the `dynamic-plugins-rhdh-local` ConfigMap with the list of dynamic plugins. We can
create another additional ConfigMap to manage it.

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::example$challenge-03/rhdh-dynamic-plugins-cm-github-01.yaml[]
----

Update the Red Hat Developer Hub manifest to use the new ConfigMap for plugins:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
spec:
  application:
    # Other configurations
    dynamicPluginsConfigMapName: rhdh-dynamic-plugins
----
--
====

[WARNING]
====
Simply enabling a dynamic plugin in the helm chart may not provide the required functionality. You may need to
edit your `app-config.yaml` files to add plugin-specific configuration (for example, set different environment variables)
to make the plugin work correctly. Consult the corresponding plugin documentation for the required configuration.
====

However, there is a way to include other dynamic plugins not included in Red Hat Developer Hub. This is a process based
on exporting third-party plugins using:

* The link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@janus-idp/cli[@janus-idp/cli] package is installed.
* Node.js and NPM is installed and configured.
* The third-party plugin is compatible with your Red Hat Developer Hub version.
For more information, see link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh/blob/main/docs/dynamic-plugins/versions.md[Version compatibility matrix].
* The third-party plugin must have a valid `package.json` file in its root directory, containing all required metadata and dependencies.

The following resources includes a full list of the current plugins in the Backstage space:

* link:https://backstage.io/plugins[Backstage Plugin Directory]
* link:https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins[Backstage Community Plugins]

A detailed guide to install third-party plugins is available
https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.8/html-single/installing_and_viewing_plugins_in_red_hat_developer_hub/index#ref-example-third-party-plugin-installation_assembly-install-third-party-plugins-rhdh[here].

We will do the exercise to install some plugins using the dynamic plugin framework of Red Hat Developer Hub.

=== TODO Plugin (Backstage Community Plugin)

This plugin lists `// TODO` comments in source code. It currently exports a single component extension for use on entity pages.

The main steps are based on the usage of the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-dynamic-plugin-factory[RHDH Dynamic Plugin Factor]:

* Pull image version of the dynamic plugin factory:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman pull quay.io/rhdh-community/dynamic-plugins-factory:1.8
----

* Create a temporary folder to create the dynamic plugin, and the initial folder structure:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
mkdir -p /tmp/backstage-community-plugins
mkdir -p /tmp/backstage-community-plugins/config
mkdir -p /tmp/backstage-community-plugins/workspace
mkdir -p /tmp/backstage-community-plugins/outputs
cd /tmp/backstage-community-plugins
----

* Setup configuration files to manage this plugin by the `source.json`, `plugins-list.yaml` files as:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cat > ./config/source.json << EOF
{
  "repo": "https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins",
  "repo-ref":"main"
}
EOF
cat > ./config/plugins-list.yaml << EOF
plugins/todo:
plugins/todo-backend:
EOF
----

* Setup your environment to push images automatically into your container registry by the `.env` file as:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cat > ./config/.env << EOF
# Registry configuration
REGISTRY_URL=<YOUR_REGISTRY>
REGISTRY_INSECURE=false

REGISTRY_USERNAME=<YOUR_USERNAME>
REGISTRY_PASSWORD=<YOUR_PASSWORD>

REGISTRY_NAMESPACE=<YOUR_NAMESPACE>
EOF
----

Please, update it with your own configuration.

* Build and publish the OCI image of the dynamic plugin into your container registry:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman run --rm -it \
  --device /dev/fuse \
  -v ./config:/config:z \
  -v ./workspace:/workspace:z \
  -v ./outputs:/outputs:z \
  quay.io/rhdh-community/dynamic-plugins-factory:1.8 \
  --workspace-path workspaces/todo \
  --push-images
----

This process will output the default configuration of the dynamic plugin to add into Red Hat Developer Hub:

Congratulations! Your Red Hat Developer Hub is fully modular.

=== (Bonus Track) Enabling SCM Plugins

The xref:challenge-03.adoc#intro[Lock It Down] challenge included a set of steps to integrate
Red Hat Developer Hub and your favourite SCM (e.g: GitHub, GitLab). That integration included
some features to discover organization data, including repositories to add automatically into
the Red Hat Developer Hub catalog. However, the integration can be extended to include more
features and plugins to enhance the experience of developers and platform engineers.

There are different plugins available to integrate some of the features of the SCM systems like
issues, pull requests, and actions. These plugins allow you to visualize and manage these features
directly from the Red Hat Developer Hub interface, providing a seamless experience for developers.

To enable these plugins, you need to modify the Red Hat Developer Hub configuration to include
the necessary plugins for your SCM system. The configuration can be done either by modifying the
`app-config.yaml` file or by using the Helm chart values file, depending on how you have deployed
Red Hat Developer Hub.
