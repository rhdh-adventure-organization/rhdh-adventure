[#configuration-solution]
== üßûüõ†Ô∏è External configuration Solution

Red Hat Developer Hub is very extensible and customizable, so the final configuration could be so long
and extended making hard its maintenance. There is a proper way to customize it using external resources
such as `ConfigMaps` and `Secrets`. Those resources can be added to the default configuration to set up
the instance completely.

There are multiple values to customize Red Hat Developer Hub, such as the base URL. The base URL
of Red Hat Developer Hub is important to allow external connections and integrations (e.g: GitHub, or GitLab).
We will create two environment variables to identify the full url to our Red Hat Developer Hub:

* `basedomain` - Represents the base url of our Red Hat OpenShift cluster.
* `rhdhname` - Represent the name of Red Hat Developer Hub exposed on Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

To get the `basedomain` execute this command:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
export basedomain=$(oc whoami --show-console | sed -E 's~https?://console-openshift-console\.apps\.(.*)~apps.\1~')
----

Getting the `rhdh-name` depends of the type of installation:

[tabs]
====
By Helm Chart::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
export rhdhname=rhdh-developer-hub-$(oc project -q)
----
--
By Operator::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
export rhdhname=backstage-rhdh-$(oc project -q)
----
--
====

[WARNING]
====
The name used for the Red Hat Developer Hub instance is `rhdh`. If you choose a different name,
please replace that pattern in the command with the name of your instance.
====

The base URL of Red Hat Developer Hub will be similar to:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
echo https://$rhdhname.$basedomain
----

This solution will use a `ConfigMap` identified as `rhdh-app-config` to extend the default configuration
applied during the installation. Here a simple use case:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::example$challenge-02/rhdh-app-config-cm-01.yaml[]
----

Customizing Red Hat Developer Hub will require at some point the usage of sensitive data (e.g: credentials, tokens...)
and we must declare in the most secure way. Using a Secret we could declare those values properly and add
into the configuration too. For example, the `BACKEND_SECRET` variable is defined to be used for service
to service authentication. Here a simple use case:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::example$challenge-02/rhdh-secrets-secret.yaml[]
----

We can apply it using the `oc` command as:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
envsubst < ./documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/challenge-02/rhdh-app-config-cm-01.yaml | oc apply -f -
oc apply -f ./documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/challenge-02/rhdh-secrets-secret.yaml
----

[TIP]
====
In the previous challenge, we defined the `basedomain` variable to be used in different configurations.
We can add that variable into the `rhdh-secrets` object for that. This patch command will add it:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc patch secret rhdh-secrets -p '{"stringData":{"basedomain":"'"${basedomain}"'"}}'
----
====

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to create those objects inside of the namespace your are deploying Red Hat Developer Hub.
Remember the usage of `rhdh-by-helm` namespace for an instance managed by the Helm Chart,
and `rhdh-by-operator` namespace for an instance managed by the Operator.

By Helm Chart::
+
--
Red Hat Developer Hub Helm Chart provides an extension to declare extra configuration by ConfigMap and Secrets.
The definition of the resources described above will be applying the next configuration into the `values.yaml` file.
Here an example of that configuration:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::example$challenge-02/values.yaml[]
----

To apply the new configuration setup, we need to upgrade our Helm Chart release:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
helm upgrade --install rhdh \
    openshift-helm-charts/redhat-developer-hub \
    -f ./documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/challenge-02/values.yaml \
    --set global.clusterRouterBase=$basedomain
----
--
By Operator::
+
--
The Backstage CRD provides an extension to declare extra configuration by ConfigMap and Secrets.
Here an example of that configuration:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::example$challenge-02/rhdh-instance.yaml[]
----

To apply the new configuration setup, we need to update the Backstage object:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f ./documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/challenge-02/rhdh-instance.yaml
----

[WARNING]
====
The name used for the Red Hat Developer Hub instance is `rhdh`. If you choose a different name,
please replace that pattern in the command with the name of your instance.

[#title-solution]
== üßû¬©Ô∏è Title it Solution

Using the configuration objects created previously add new configuration is easy, just add the new
configuration there. For example, to define the title of our instance, update the `rhdh-app-config`
ConfigMap adding the attribute `app.title` as:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: rhdh-app-config
data:
  rhdh-app-config.yaml: |
    # Other configuration
    app:
      title: "My Adventure with Red Hat Developer Hub"
----

And full example from the previous activity:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::example$challenge-02/rhdh-app-config-cm-02.yaml[]
----

Applying the new configuration by updating the ConfigMap:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
envsubst < ./documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/challenge-02/rhdh-app-config-cm-02.yaml | oc apply -f -
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are running a Red Hat Developer Hub instance managed by the Operator, every time a ConfigMap
or Secret included in the configuration is updated, the operator will redeploy the instance.
You don't need to do anything else.

However, if you are using the Helm Chart, then a deployment restart must be done. You can trigger it
with the following command:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
helm upgrade --install rhdh \
    openshift-helm-charts/redhat-developer-hub \
    -f ./documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/challenge-02/values.yaml \
    --set global.clusterRouterBase=$basedomain
----

Or run a restart of the `Deployment` object of Red Hat Developer Hub

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc rollout restart deployment/rhdh-developer-hub
----
====

[WARNING]
====
The name used for the Red Hat Developer Hub instance is `rhdh`. If you choose a different name,
please replace that pattern in the command with the name of your instance.

[#colors-solution]
== üßûüåà Looking better Solution

Red Hat Developer Hub includes a default theme aligned with Red Hat branding products style, however, that
theme is customizable too. The following extension of the `rhdh-app-config` ConfigMap will define different
colour schema:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: rhdh-app-config

            headerColor1: 'hsl(204 100% 71%)'
            headerColor2: 'color(a98-rgb 1 0 0)'
            navigationIndicatorColor: '#be0000'
          dark:
            primaryColor: '#ab75cf'
            headerColor1: '#0000d0'
