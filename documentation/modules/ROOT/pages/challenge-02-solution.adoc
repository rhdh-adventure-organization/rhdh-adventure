== üßûüé® Make It Your Own Solution

Welcome! Don't worry about being here‚Äîit's absolutely okay! This section provides an example solution
to the challenge, offering a step-by-step implementation as a reference to guide you.

Remember, this is just one way to solve the challenge, and your approach might differ depending on
your creativity or specific requirements. Feel free to explore and adapt the solution to make it your own.
The goal is to help you understand the process and give you the confidence to tackle similar challenges
in the future. Let' 's dive in together! üßûüöÄ

[#configuration-solution]
== üßûüõ†Ô∏è External configuration Solution

Red Hat Developer Hub is very extensible and customizable, so the final configuration could be so long
and extended making hard its maintenance. There is a proper way to customize it using external resources
such as `ConfigMaps` and `Secrets`. Those resources can be added to the default configuration to set up
the instance completely.

This solution will use a `ConfigMap` identified as `rhdh-app-config` to extend the default configuration
applied during the installation. Here a simple use case:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::example$challenge-02/rhdh-app-config-cm-01.yaml[]
----

Customizing Red Hat Developer Hub will require at some point the usage of sensitive data (e.g: credentials, tokens...)
and we must declare in the most secure way. Using a Secret we could declare those values properly and add
into the configuration too. For example, the `BACKEND_SECRET` variable is defined to be used for service
to service authentication. Here a simple use case:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::example$challenge-02/rhdh-secrets-secret.yaml[]
----

We can apply it using the `oc` command as:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f ./documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/challenge-02/rhdh-app-config-cm-01.yaml
oc apply -f ./documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/challenge-02/rhdh-secrets-secret.yaml
----

[TIP]
====
In the previous challenge, we defined the `basedomain` variable to be used in different configurations.
We can add that variable into the `rhdh-secrets` object for that. This patch command will add it:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc patch secret rhdh-secrets -p '{"stringData":{"basedomain":"'"${basedomain}"'"}}'
----
====

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to create those objects inside of the namespace your are deploying Red Hat Developer Hub.
Remember the usage of `rhdh-by-helm` namespace for an instance managed by the Helm Chart,
and `rhdh-by-operator` namespace for an instance managed by the Operator.

By Helm Chart::
+
--
Red Hat Developer Hub Helm Chart provides an extension to declare extra configuration by ConfigMap and Secrets.
The definition of the resources described above will be applying the next configuration into the `values.yaml` file.
Here an example of that configuration:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::example$challenge-02/values.yaml[]
----

To apply the new configuration setup, we need to upgrade our Helm Chart release:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
helm upgrade --install rhdh \
    openshift-helm-charts/redhat-developer-hub \
    -f ./documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/challenge-02/values.yaml \
    --set global.clusterRouterBase=$basedomain
----
--
By Operator::
+
--
The Backstage CRD provides an extension to declare extra configuration by ConfigMap and Secrets.
Here an example of that configuration:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::example$challenge-02/rhdh-instance.yaml[]
----

To apply the new configuration setup, we need to update the Backstage object:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f ./documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/challenge-02/rhdh-instance.yaml
----

[#title-solution]
== üßû¬©Ô∏è Title it Solution

Using the configuration objects created previously add new configuration is easy, just add the new
configuration there. For example, to define the title of our instance, update the `rhdh-app-config`
ConfigMap adding the attribute `app.title` as:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: rhdh-app-config
data:
  rhdh-app-config.yaml: |
    # Other configuration
    app:
      title: "My Adventure with Red Hat Developer Hub"
----

And full example from the previous activity:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::example$challenge-02/rhdh-app-config-cm-02.yaml[]
----

Applying the new configuration by updating the ConfigMap:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f ./documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/challenge-02/rhdh-app-config-cm-02.yaml
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are running a Red Hat Developer Hub instance managed by the Operator, every time a ConfigMap
or Secret included in the configuration is updated, the operator will redeploy the instance.
You don't need to do anything else.

However, if you are using the Helm Chart, then a deployment restart must be done. You can trigger it
with the following command:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
helm upgrade --install rhdh \
    openshift-helm-charts/redhat-developer-hub \
    -f ./documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/challenge-02/values.yaml \
    --set global.clusterRouterBase=$basedomain
----

Or run a restart of the `Deployment` object of Red Hat Developer Hub

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc rollout restart deployment/rhdh-developer-hub
----

[#colors-solution]
== üßûüåà Looking better Solution

Red Hat Developer Hub includes a default theme aligned with Red Hat branding products style, however, that
theme is customizable too. The following extension of the `rhdh-app-config` ConfigMap will define different
colour schema:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: rhdh-app-config
data:
  rhdh-app-config.yaml: |
    app:
      # Other application configuration
      branding:
        theme:
          light:
            primaryColor: '#38be8b'
            headerColor1: 'hsl(204 100% 71%)'
            headerColor2: 'color(a98-rgb 1 0 0)'
            navigationIndicatorColor: '#be0000'
          dark:
            primaryColor: '#ab75cf'
            headerColor1: '#0000d0'
            headerColor2: 'rgb(255 246 140)'
