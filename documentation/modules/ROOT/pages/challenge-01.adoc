Any journey starts with a first step... and here we have the first one: install Red Hat Developer Hub.
It is easy, but you should choose which model is the most suitable for you:

* Red Hat Developer Hub Helm Chart
* Red Hat Developer Hub Operator

Here you will identify which installation and operational mechanism is better to support
the Red Hat Developer Hub life cycle (install, upgrade...). The rest of your adventure will continue from here.

The challenge is to create and customize the necessary manifests, successfully deploy
a Red Hat Developer Hub instance on OpenShift, and expose it to external users. The challenge will be
considered successful when Red Hat Developer Hub is fully functional, accessible via its landing page,
and configured correctly using the deployment mechanism chosen.

[#helmchart]
== ðŸ“¦ Helm Chart

Helm is a powerful package manager for Kubernetes, designed to simplify the deployment and management
of complex applications. By utilizing Helm Charts, users can package pre-configured Kubernetes manifests
into reusable templates, enabling a faster and more consistent deployment experience. Helm is widely adopted
for its ability to manage application lifecycles efficiently, allowing teams to quickly configure and
deploy applications across different environments.

The key benefit of using Helm Charts lies in their flexibility and reusability.

Red Hat Developer Hub provides a Helm Chart which can define configurations, dependencies, and resource
templates in one place. This enables you to deploy Red Hat Developer Hub instances with minimal effort,
while also ensuring consistency and reducing human errors.

[#operator]
== ðŸ‘· Operator

Kubernetes Operators represent an advanced method for managing applications by automating the deployment,
configuration, and lifecycle management of complex workloads. Operators extend Kubernetes functionality by
encoding operational knowledge into a custom resource and a controller, making them particularly useful for
stateful or highly complex applications.

The primary benefit of using Operators is their ability to automate application management tasks that would
typically require manual intervention.

Red Hat Developer Hub provides an Operator which can achieve self-healing, seamless scaling, and automated upgrades.
This automation significantly reduces operational overhead while maintaining consistency and reliability.
